# Discriminative-and-Generative-Classifiers-for-handwritten-digits
In this handwritten digit classifier problem, I have implemented and analyzed the Discriminative and Generative Classifiers and compared their results and behavior. I have implemented the solution into four steps, and the classifiers I used are SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and K-NN, with their different configurations.
